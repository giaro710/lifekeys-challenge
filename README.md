# Courses.

## Introduction

This project is a mockup of a site that offers courses. Browse the courses page, follow the lesson and do the final test to master the topic.

## How to start the project

To start the server you need `npm` to be installed in your computer. Download the repository and inside the terminal run

```bash
npm install
```

to install all the needed packages and then run

```bash
npm start
```

to run the server. Then, in the browser go to `http://localhost:3000` to navigate through the application.

## Future developments

- Add a sign up logic in order to track the user experience on the site (check if the user did some course or not)
- Retrieve data from external API
- Handle data and the state of components with Redux
