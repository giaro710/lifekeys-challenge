          "textContent": "First things first, you’ll need to make sure you have the spices and supplies you need to start cooking. If you have “curry powder,” in your spice cabinet, we’ve got bad news for you – you won’t be using it in Indian cooking! “Curry powder” is not Indian at all. In India, curry spice mixes are called “garam masala.” To begin equipping your spice cabinet, you’ll want: Garam masala, preferably from an Indian store Green and black cardamom Turmeric powder Cumin powder Red chili/cayenne pepper powder Coriander powder Whole cumin seeds Whole brown mustard seeds Cloves Cinnamon/cassia bark Black pepper Nutmeg Mace Fenugreek You’ll also want plenty of ginger and garlic on-hand, as well as cilantro, bay leaves, and some other spices and fresh herbs, depending on the recipes you’re cooking. Yes, this sounds like a lot – so if you’re just getting started, we recommend consulting the recipe you want to cook, and just purchasing the spices for that specific recipe. Then, if you end up loving the process of cooking Indian food, you can try new recipes – and add spices to your cabinet as necessary. You’ll also need basmati rice – which you can find in bulk at most Indian stores or ethnic supermarkets. As far as cooking tools and utensils, you probably already have everything you need. As long as you have a wok, a set of high-quality pans, a pressure cooker, and a steamer, you can cook pretty much any Indian dish. "

          "textContent": "If you’ve ever spent a lot of time cooking a particular type of cuisine – such as Italian – you’ll know that many dishes use a similar pattern. Italian pasta meals, for example, usually start by making a sauce using olive oil, a tomato base, fresh herbs, and garlic. Then, you may fry some meat if the recipe calls for it, boil the noodles – you get the picture. You will begin by heating some kind of oil in a pan To the hot pan, you will add whole spices which you will saute, such as cardamom, cloves, cumin, or cinnamon sticks. This is known as “tempering” Next, you’ll add vegetables – usually onions or some other type of vegetable, followed by tomatoes After this, you’ll add more powdered spices to achieve the desired flavors The next step is to create a base by adding water to create a curry, adding dairy for a dish like butter chicken, or even adding the mixture to lentils to create daal, and cook it for some time These above steps are generalized, of course, and can vary a bit. But mostly, when you cook Indian food, you will start by tempering oil, frying some vegetables, and adding spices and a sauce base. This is the basis for a lot of Indian dishes that you’ll be making when you start out, from butter chicken to chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, biryani and more."

When you’re cooking a new dish for the first time, you’re going to make mistakes. Maybe your curry will be watery, or won’t be flavorful enough. Maybe you burn some of your onions. Perhaps your chicken is overdone in your tikka – that’s okay! Every time you make a dish, you will improve. As you become more comfortable with the cooking process for the dish you’re making, it will begin to taste better and better! Eventually, you’ll master it – and the skills you’ve learned making that dish will transfer to other dishes, too. Then, you can pick a new dish to try and master – and continue doing so, until you know how to cook all of your favorite Indian foods. The best way to learn is by doing, and with the tips and resources above, you’ll have all of the information that you need to cook delicious Indian cuisine – even if you’ve never made an Indian dish before."

Your DSLR does not take better photos just because it costs more - the reason you can take better photos with it is because you get more control over your settings.  So if you don’t take that control, you won’t get better images! In time, you definitely want to shoot in manual mode. Manual mode is when you take control of all THREE elements of exposure (aperture, shutter speed and ISO) and get the right exposure for the scene you are trying to photograph (which may be an entirely different exposure than the one your camera would give you!) So if you  are on AUTO at the moment, take your first steps away from this with Aperture Priority Mode. If you are already on Aperture Priority mode, then make the switch to manual! I promise, once you truly learn this, you’ll never go back as you’ll see the massive effect this can have on your photos. "

Well, light indoors is MUCH easier to deal with because we’re no longer at the mercy of mother nature, which can be a little bit more challenging! "

A big one for this is the settings for your FOCUS. So many people struggle with getting sharp photos - and it’s easy to see why! There is a LOT of different elements that go into getting a sharp photo, so it’s not a case of throwing some random tips at you and hoping for the best :-) But a really common one for new photographers is that they’re using too slow a shutter speed for what they are photographing, especially if they are not shooting in manual mode. Keep this in mind - the minimum shutter speed for handholding a lens is at least 1/60 (sometimes more depending on the lens) and the absolute minimum shutter speed is 1/125 for a person. Did you note that i said MINIMUM? Ideally, you always want to be higher than these minimum speeds, especially if you’re photographing a child (I rarely go under 1/250 for a child, even if they’re still)"

Composition is simply how you arrange the various elements within the frame in order to make your photos more engaging and impactful.  You can use the rule of thirds, framing, leading lines (which is what you see below) to draw your viewers eye around the frame or make your images more dynamic. Again, aiming at those who are new to photography - start with the rule of thirds. It’s the most simple one to use, but it has a big impact. Simply imagine that your photograph is divided into nine equal sections by two horizontal and two vertical lines like the image below. Our eyes are naturally drawn to the points where these four lines intersect (where those little pink circles are) Placing a point of interest on one of these intersections, or simply placing elements along one of the lines, gives the photo more balance and make it more appealing to the viewer!"

Although you can learn by ear, if you don't have formal training or a serious gift that could prove quite difficult. Learning to read music will also benefit you in that you won't necessarily have to hear the song to know how it is played, though that does help tremendously. There are several free programs on the internet that give you a brief intro to reading music, and those work well for getting you started. If you want to continue on and become very proficient at reading music then either a lot of practice is in order or you could invest in an online piano course. These are usually about as expensive as a book at the local music store, but provide you with videos and audio clips as well to help you along in the process. There are several articles here that help you get started with reading music and should get you on track to teaching yourself to read music. The other option is to invest in a book from the local bookstore. It will be a little bit less interactive, but certainly with some effort will teach you to read music. Look for freebies online before you do this one though."

It is an incredibly useful tool when teaching yourself to play because it lets you practice single measures at a time and have the instructions right in front of you! There are some places online that let you view sheet music for free with perhaps a trail membership or something similar but sometimes they don't let you print the music out. Printing the music is in my opinion essential to the learning process. This lets you write notes on the page and keep better track of issues you are having with a song. Some sheet music places let you have total access to the sheet music for an inexpensive annual fee while others charge a small fee for each download. I prefer the monthly subscription model because then I can download and print as much music as I want to. If you are only looking to learn a few songs, then perhaps at this point the pay-per-download model of sheet music website is a better option, allowing you to pay for how much you actually use the service. Physical sheet music in music stores is another option, though it is usually much more costly because the publisher must print and distribute the sheet music, then of course the music store adds their own margin on top of that...it adds up pretty quick when you are considering purchasing more than a few pieces of music.

A good practice program involves some warm ups, scales, new songs being attempted, working on old songs, sight reading (similar to new songs being attempted) and other various technical exercises. You can find a few good practice routines on this site as well as searching Google for others."

          "textContent": "Mindfulness is a mind-body medicine practice, based on ancient Zen Buddhist meditation techniques, that was popularized by Jon Kabat-Zinn, a researcher at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. According to Kabat-Zinn, mindfulness is an internal resource that all of us already have within us. The idea is to channel or direct this resource to transform our relationships with stress, emotions, pain, and illness. Indeed, controlled research studies suggest that mindfulness-based interventions can effectively reduce symptoms in people with chronic pain, recurrent depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, binge-eating, and many other health conditions. Mindfulness interventions have also been shown to change the brain's grey matter and reactivity to emotional stimuli in ways that promote greater conscious control over emotion. While most people seem to think that mindfulness is a good thing, many people are confused about what exactly mindfulness is. Does it involve emptying the brain of thoughts, inducing relaxation, or going into a trance? Do you have to go live in an ashram and retreat from the material world to practice it effectively?  Is it a kind of religion or cult, and is it potentially dangerous?  In fact, none of the above have been shown to be true. Below is a description of some key concepts that can help illuminate what it means to have a mindful attitude to life."

          "textContent": "Focus on the Present Moment—When your thoughts get lost in thinking about the past or worrying about the future, you bring them back to what you are experiencing right now. You try to remain open to how things unfold in the present, rather than having preconceived ideas about how things will or should turn out. Being Fully Present—You are spaciously aware of whatever you are experiencing in the present moment as you go through your daily life. What do you feel in your body? What are you seeing, hearing, doing - right now? Openness to Experience—Rather than dreading and shutting out your own feelings and experiences because you think you can't handle them, you welcome with curiosity any thoughts and feelings that naturally arise, knowing they are merely sensations in the moment and the next moment can be different. You create mental spaciousness to contain these thoughts and fellings. Become aware of your experience as a flow of sensations, thoughts, and feelings and watch how these change and transform naturally over time."

        {
          "title": "Key concepts (2)",
          "textContent": "Non-Judgment—You don't categorize your thoughts and feelings as good or bad, try to change them, or feel compelled to act on them. All feelings have a purpose, whether to protect you from danger or open you to love. You watch and accept whatever arises in consciousness with an open mind. You extend this non-judging attitude to other people and things. Acceptance of Things as They Are—You don't try to force or change reality to fit your vision of what it should be, feel like a victim, or bemoan the unfairness of life. Instead, you try to see reality clearly and let it be as it is, knowing that you can tolerate whatever it is that comes up. You extend this acceptance to others, knowing they are the best judges of what is right for them. Connection—You feel connected to all living things and nature in being part of a larger whole. You reflect on and feel grateful for the cycle of life and the food, beauty, and protection that nature gives us. You know that all living beings want to feel happy and secure and avoid suffering and you feel connected by similarity of needs and experience."

        {
          "title": "Key concepts (3)",
          "textContent": "Non-Attachment—You do not try to hold onto things, people, or experiences, knowing that life is in constant flow. Attachment comes from fear and is the basis of suffering. You learn to surf the wave of life, going with the flow and being confident in your own ability to adapt. When one door closes, another opens. Peace and Equanimity—You maintain an even-keel, not getting too swept up in life's highs and lows. You know that life is a cycle and you can't see the whole picture at any one moment. When things don't go your way, you stay firmly rooted in your own clear vision and values. You walk with a peaceful heart and adopt a non-harming, non-violent attitude. Compassion—You deal gently, kindly, and patiently with yourself and others. Rather than judging, or condemning, you open your heart to really listen and try to understand your own and other people's experiences. You allow yourself to feel other people's suffering. You love people not for what they can give you or because you need something from them, but because you connect and empathize with their experiences."
